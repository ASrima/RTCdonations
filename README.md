# RTCdonations
*under construction, please watch your step* Prakhya: My idea is to built a web and/or mobile application that makes donating our things easier, faster, more efficient and impactful. According to research 85-90% of homeless youth have access to internet. Through our application, there could be a search engine to find what they specifically need and where to find it. People who are interested in donating could post what it is that they are donating and a drop-off spot. I am also working on building a messaging interface.  I've been looking at several javascript, html/css tutorials to be able to have a posting interface where users can input text that appears in a forum.
